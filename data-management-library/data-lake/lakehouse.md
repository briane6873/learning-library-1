# Lake House: Putting it Together for Analytics

## Introduction

The Data Lake is really all of the pieces working together to ingest data in many different forms from APIs, database, file formats and locations. The catalog documents the metadata and business value of the data with classifying data with business meaning and where the data is found. Data integrations allows for ETL processes and loading of new data assets along with the OCI Data Flows to process and filter new data and store as new data assets. Then the querying of the data whether or not using SQL to pull from the data lake or other reporting tools, the data assets in the data lake can now be consumed for business reporting and analytics.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Query the data values
* Validate that new data is being loaded
* Review the components of the Data Lake

Estimated Time:15 minutes

## Task 1: SQL Queries

## Next Steps
Congratulations! You have now completed the Oracle Cloud Lake House LiveLab.
Be sure to check out the labs on Oracle Machine Learning and how the Lake House fits into the Movie Stream story and lab.
